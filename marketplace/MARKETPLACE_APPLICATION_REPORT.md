### 4. Contact Seller Logic
- The logic in the `contact_seller_form` function has been updated to ensure unique room names.

### 5. User Messages
- Pagination has been considered for the `user_messages` function.

### 6. Reply Functionality
- Ensure that the message is validated before saving in the `reply_form` function.

### 7. Item Search
- In the `search_items` function, consider adding error handling for cases where the query is empty.

### 8. URL Patterns
- The URL patterns in `urls.py` are well-defined, but consider adding trailing slashes to the `search_results` path for consistency.
